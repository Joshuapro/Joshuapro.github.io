            I have never thought that paintings can be used for <strong>manipulation</strong>. With the help of camera movements and sound, paintings can be converted to different
            interpretations. For example, from the left painting above, one might not interpret anything at first; however, when the camera is zoomed in on the right painting, it reveals different meanings.

            Paintings were once used to demonstrate ones <strong>existence</strong> and <strong>power</strong>. Paintings focused on dressing and jewels on women as shown above. I find this very similar in mordern portrait photographs, where people usually take them to record their existence.
