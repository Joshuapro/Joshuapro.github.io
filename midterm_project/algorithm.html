            When someone sends a person a Bitcoin over the block chain, they are actually sending a hashed version of the "public key". On the other handm, a bitcoin private key is a large (256 bits) secret number that allows bitcoin to be unlocked and sent.

            Everytranaction in Bitcoin  is broadcasted to all networks. Transactions are recorded into a distributed replicated public database known as the blockchain.

            Bitcoin uses the UTXO model or Unspent output from bitcoin transactions. The model allows for an enviroment where parallel processing across multiple addresses is possible. The mechanism is a continual transgression of inputs and outputs, where the owner of tokens do not directly own the tokens, but rather owns the output to a specific number of tokens that can then be signed over as an input to a new owner, who controls the new outputs, as seen in the figure.<br><br>
                There are 3 rules to follow for UTXO:<br>
                1. Every transaction must prove that the sum of its inputs are greater than outputs<br>
                2. Every referenced input must be valid <br>
                3. Transactions must have digital signitures matching the owner input in every input<br><br>
